      <p>This forest is HAUNTED!</p>
      <p>This forest is so haunted, you can't believe it. The trees have twisted, scowling faces. Giant cobwebs stretch for miles. Witches tempt kids into their mouldering cabins...to cook them!</p>
      <p>NO, IT CANOPY!</p>
      <p>Forget about the rain forest, this is the PAIN FOREST! There's disembodied spirits, skeletons a plenty, twisted, clawing branches...</p>
      <p>AND A WRESTLING RING MADE OF ANCIENT OAK AND VINES!</p>
      <p>That's the spot! That's where the wrestling happens!</p>
      <p>PERIOD!</p>
      <p>Goblin suplexes...Baba Yagas doing backflips! Brownies and sprites bodyslamming eachother from tree to tree! It's crazy and illegal, as usual!</p>
      <p>We're Goin' BOG WILD!</p>
      <p>Exult with us in an Autumnal Equinox celebration! Let's tempt the forces of darkness and once again revel in their failure to consume us. Join your flesh to the vast root network that pumps and pulses with the heart of the night! The huge trees reach their nasty fingers up, up, up...But we battle below, drinking beer and wrestling hard!</p>`
